# Project: AMLS_assignment24_25

## Overview
This project is the Applied Machine Learning Systems (AMLS) assignment, which focuses on implementing machine learning models to solve binary and multi-class classification tasks using the BreastMNIST and BloodMNIST datasets.

## File Descriptions
- `main.py`: Main script that runs tasks A and B.
- `A/`:
   - `TaskACNN.py`: CNN implementation for Task A.
   - `TaskASVM.py`: SVM implementation for Task A.
- `B/`: 
   - `TaskBCNN.py`: CNN implementation for Task B.
   - `TaskBSVM.py`: SVM implementation for Task B.
- `README.md`: Overview, setup instructions, and file descriptions.
